# Rule for running R scripts

This rule executes R scripts to create various file outputs.

## Usage

``` r
rRule(
  target,
  script,
  depends = NULL,
  params = list(),
  task = "all",
  preBuild = NULL,
  postBuild = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- target:

  Name of output files to be created

- script:

  Name of the R script to be executed

- depends:

  A vector of file names that the R script depends on, or `NULL`.

- params:

  A list of R values that become available within the `script` in a
  `params` variable.

- task:

  A character vector of parent task names. The mechanism of tasks allows
  grouping rules. Anything different from `'all'` will cause the
  creation of a new task depending on the given rule. Executing
  `make taskname` will then force building this rule.

- preBuild:

  A character vector of shell commands to be executed before building
  the target

- postBuild:

  A character vector of shell commands to be executed after building the
  target

## Value

Instance of S3 class `rmake.rule`

## Details

In detail, this rule executes the following command in a separate R
process: `params <- params; source(script)`

That is, the parameters given in the `params` argument are stored in the
global variable and then the `script` is sourced. Note that the
re-generation of the `Makefile` with any change to `params` will not
cause the re-execution of the recipe unless other script dependencies
change.

Issuing `make clean` from the shell causes removal of all files
specified in the `target` parameter.
