# General creator of an instance of the S3 `rmake.rule` class

A rule is an atomic element of the build process. It defines a set of
`target` file names to be built with a given `build` command from a
given set of `depends` files that the targets depend on, and which can
be removed by a given `clean` command.

## Usage

``` r
rule(
  target,
  depends = NULL,
  build = NULL,
  clean = NULL,
  task = "all",
  phony = FALSE,
  type = ""
)
```

## Arguments

- target:

  A character vector of target file names that are created by the given
  build command

- depends:

  A character vector of file names the build command depends on

- build:

  A shell command that runs the build of the given target

- clean:

  A shell command that erases all files produced by the build command

- task:

  A character vector of parent task names. The mechanism of tasks allows
  grouping rules. Anything different from `'all'` will cause the
  creation of a new task depending on the given rule. Executing
  `make taskname` will then force building this rule.

- phony:

  Whether the rule has a `PHONY` (i.e., non-file) target. A rule should
  be marked with `phony` if the target is not a file name that would be
  generated by the `build` commands. E.g., `all` or `clean` are phony
  targets. Also, all targets representing tasks (see `task` above) are
  phony.

- type:

  A string representing a type of rule used e.g. when printing a rule in
  an easily readable format. For instance,
  [`rRule()`](https://beerda.github.io/rmake/reference/rRule.md) uses
  `R`,
  [`markdownRule()`](https://beerda.github.io/rmake/reference/markdownRule.md)
  uses `markdown`, etc.

## Value

Instance of S3 class `rmake.rule`

## Details

If there is a need to group some rules together, one can assign them the
same task identifier in the `task` argument. Each rule may be assigned
one or more tasks. Tasks may then be built by executing `make task_name`
on the command line, which forces rebuilding of all rules assigned to
task `'task_name'`. By default, all rules are assigned to task `all`,
which causes the `make all` command to build everything.
