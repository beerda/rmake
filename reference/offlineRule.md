# Rule for requesting manual user action

Instead of building the target, this rule simply issues the given error
message. This rule is useful for cases where the target `target` depends
on `depends` but must be updated by some manual process. So if `target`
is older than any of its dependencies, `make` will throw an error until
the user manually updates the target.

## Usage

``` r
offlineRule(target, message, depends = NULL, task = "all")
```

## Arguments

- target:

  A character vector of target file names of the manual (offline) build
  command

- message:

  An error message to be issued if targets are older than dependencies
  in `depends`

- depends:

  A character vector of file names the targets depend on

- task:

  A character vector of parent task names. The mechanism of tasks allows
  grouping rules. Anything different from `'all'` will cause the
  creation of a new task depending on the given rule. Executing
  `make taskname` will then force building this rule.

## Value

Instance of S3 class `rmake.rule`
