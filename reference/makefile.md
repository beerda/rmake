# Generate Makefile from a given list of rules (`job`).

In the (GNU) `make` jargon, a *rule* is a sequence of commands to build
a result. In this package, a rule should be understood similarly: It is
a command or a sequence of commands that optionally produces some files
and depends on some other files (such as data files or scripts) or other
rules. Moreover, a rule contains a command for cleanup, i.e., for
removal of generated files.

## Usage

``` r
makefile(
  job = list(),
  fileName = NULL,
  makeScript = "Makefile.R",
  vars = NULL,
  all = TRUE,
  tasks = TRUE,
  clean = TRUE,
  makefile = TRUE,
  depends = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- job:

  A list of rules (i.e., instances of the S3 class `rmake.rule` - see
  [`rule()`](https://beerda.github.io/rmake/reference/rule.md))

- fileName:

  A file to write to. If `NULL`, the result is returned as a character
  vector instead of writing to a file.

- makeScript:

  The name of the file that calls this function (used to generate the
  `makefile` rule)

- vars:

  A named character vector of shell variables that will be declared in
  the resulting Makefile (in addition to `[defaultVars]`)

- all:

  `TRUE` if the `all` rule should be automatically created and added:
  the created `all` rule has dependencies on all the other rules, which
  causes everything to be built if `make all` is executed in the shell's
  command line.

- tasks:

  `TRUE` if "task" rules should be automatically created and added – see
  [`rule()`](https://beerda.github.io/rmake/reference/rule.md) for more
  details.

- clean:

  `TRUE` if the `clean` rule should be automatically created and added

- makefile:

  `TRUE` if the `Makefile` rule should be automatically created and
  added: this rule ensures that any change in the R script that
  generates the `Makefile` (i.e., that calls `makefile()`) triggers the
  re-generation of the Makefile at the beginning of any build.

- depends:

  A character vector of file names that the makefile generating script
  depends on

## Value

If `fileName` is `NULL`, the function returns a character vector with
the contents of the Makefile. Otherwise, the content is written to the
given `fileName`.

## Details

The `makefile()` function takes a list of rules (see
[`rule()`](https://beerda.github.io/rmake/reference/rule.md)) and
generates a `Makefile` from them. Additionally, `all` and `clean` rules
are optionally generated too, which can be executed from the shell by
issuing the `make all` or `make clean` command, respectively, to build
everything or erase all generated files.

If there is a need to group some rules together, it can be done either
via dependencies or by using the `task` mechanism. Each rule may be
assigned one or more tasks (see `task` in
[`rule()`](https://beerda.github.io/rmake/reference/rule.md)). Each task
is then created as a standalone rule depending on the assigned rules.
That way, executing `make task_name` will build all rules with the
assigned task `task_name`. By default, all rules are assigned to task
`all`, which allows `make all` to build everything.
